### Notes:

- Replace `yourusername/yourproject` with the actual GitHub repository URL.
- Modify the commands (`chmod +x *.py`, `./interpreter.py`, etc.) based on your project's specific requirements.
- Update the list of authors (`John Doe`, `Jane Smith`, etc.) with the names and email addresses of the contributors to your project.
- Ensure the `AUTHORS` file follows a similar format to Docker's AUTHORS page, listing all individuals who have contributed to the repository.

This `README.md` template provides a clear overview of your project, instructions for starting and using the command interpreter, and details about the project's contributors. It serves as a helpful guide for users and collaborators who interact with your Python command-line interpreter.
